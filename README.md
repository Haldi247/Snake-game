# Snake-game
For my OOP project I implemented the c++ code of the snake game. 
I closely followed the C++ Snake game using raylib - Beginner Tutorial 🐍 (OOP) by Programming With Nick: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGqsnM_WEK4
I further extended this code to include a highscore, speed up the snake after certain checkpoints, and changed the visuals. 
My code does not include any audio files mainly because I didn't want to include that.
